## 💡 About Me  

I am a backend developer focused on building **scalable, maintainable, and high-performance systems**.  
I enjoy designing clean backend architectures, optimizing performance, and developing reliable APIs and services.  

I also work with **AI/ML-powered applications**, building intelligent systems that combine backend engineering with machine learning and LLM integrations.
